## The dataset (ToothGrowth)

The set of "data sets" contains data sets used to make examples, in particular it contains the famous set [Iris] that was used by Fisher to exemplify and develop various statistical themes

[Iris]:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set

On the other hand in this exercise we use the dataset [ToothGrowth] which registers the response to the length of the cells [odontoblasts], which are responsible for the production of the substance [dentin] for tooth growth, In 60 Guinea pigs who Received three different doses of vitamin C administered in two forms (orange juice and ascorbic acid).

[odontoblasts]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odontoblast 
[dentin]:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentin

So, we load the dataset...

```{r cars}
library(datasets)
data <- ToothGrowth
```


## Exploratory analysis
The descriptive statistics of the variables in our data set are shown in Table 1. The descriptive statistics of the variables in our dataset are shown in Table 1.


```{r}
kable(summary(data))
```

Table 1: Note the distribution of the vitamin C pathway, 30 individuals with orange juice (OJ) and 30 individuals given ascorbic acid (VC).

It is also worth noting the distribution of doses in the table, as can be seen in Table 2. Each group of the form of administration of vitamin C (OJ or VC) has 10 individuals to whom 0.5 or 1 or 2 mg / day, We would say it was a well-designed experiment.

```{r}
kable(table(data$supp, data$dose))
```

Table 2: Distribution of the individuals in the sample by vitamin C pathway and dose.

On the other hand, in figure 1 (upper) is the distribution of the length of the teeth, in the sample, in the function of the administration route and also in figure 2 (down) is the distribution of the length Of the teeth depending on the dose administered.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
g1 <- ggplot(data, aes( len )) +geom_density(aes(color = factor(supp))) + ylab('')+ xlab('') + theme_bw() + theme(legend.title=element_blank()) +ggtitle("Tooth len by vitamin C pathway")  
g2 <- ggplot(data, aes( len )) +geom_density(aes(color = factor(dose)))  +
 geom_density() +ylab('')+ xlab('') + theme_bw() + theme(legend.title=element_blank()) + ggtitle("Tooth len by vitamin C dose") 
multiplot(g1, g2)
```

Figure 1: Tooth length distribution (upper) by pathway and (down) dose.

## Hypothesis tests

We first used a student t test to contrast the hypothesis that the mean length of the cells in the sets formed by individuals to which the administration of vitamin C per juice is *equal* to the group given ascorbic acid.

```{r}
t.test(len ~ supp, data = data)
```


Since the $ p-value $ of the test is greater than 0.05 then the __null hypothesis__ that both groups have the same mean __is not rejected__, although this variable is distributed differently as we can see in figure 1 (upper), *so that in the context of the problem both administration routes showed similar results in terms of tooth growth*.

We now perform a Student's t test to test the hypothesis that the dose of vitamin C administered has the same results in the group receiving 0.5 mg / day and the group receiving 1 mg / day in tooth growth.


```{r}
t.test(len ~ supp, data = subset(data, dose %in% c(0.5,1) ))
```


In this case, the $ p-value $ of the test is less than 0.05, thus rejecting the hypothesis that the length of the teeth is the same in both groups with a confidence of 0.95%.
Then we repeated the test for the groups that received 1 mg / day and 2 mg / day

```{r}
t.test(len ~ supp, data = subset(data, dose %in% c(1,2) ))
```

In this case, since $ p-value $ is less than 0.05, we do not reject the hypothesis that both groups have the same mean for the variable that measures the length of the teeth. As we can see in Figure 2 (below) the group receiving 1 mg / day has a less different distribution than the group receiving 2 mg / day (as they share the mean) with respect to the group receiving 0.5 mg / day Because with this does not share the average).

## Conclusion


The route of administration does not affect the growth of the guinea pigs' teeth, this may be orange juice or ascorbic acid, however the dose does affect the average length, in the group where 2 mg / day was administered Greater growth however this is very similar to that of the group that only received 1 mg / day
